    "## 1.1 The Formation Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The question this framework addresses is old and precisely stated: given a collection of atoms whose identities are known, what spatial arrangements do they adopt under specified thermodynamic conditions? This is not a question about trajectories, nor about reaction kinetics, nor about electronic structure per se. It is a question about **endpoints** — the stable or metastable configurations that emerge when interatomic forces drive a system toward equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call these endpoints *formations*. A formation is a local minimum on the potential energy surface of a system of $N$ particles interacting through pairwise and multi-body classical potentials at temperature $T$ and density $\\rho$. The engine that produces formations is therefore a mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}: \\{Z_1, \\ldots, Z_N\\} \\times (T, \\rho, \\text{seed}) \\;\\longrightarrow\\; \\{\\mathbf{X}^*, \\mathcal{E}^*, \\mathcal{C}\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_i$ is the atomic number of particle $i$, $\\mathbf{X}^*$ is the equilibrium geometry, $\\mathcal{E}^*$ is the decomposed energy at that geometry, and $\\mathcal{C}$ is a classification label derived from structural analysis of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mapping is deterministic: the same inputs produce the same output. The seed controls all stochastic elements — initial velocity sampling, perturbation noise, random number generator state — so that every formation is reproducible without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framing has a consequence that should be stated upfront. The engine does not *know* what water looks like. It does not store the fact that water is bent at 104.5° or that the O–H bond length is 0.96 Å. It knows only that oxygen has atomic number 8, mass 15.999 amu, electronegativity 3.44, covalent radius 0.66 Å, and a set of Lennard-Jones parameters derived from the Universal Force Field. If the force field, integration scheme, and thermodynamic boundary conditions are correct, the 104.5° angle and 0.96 Å bond length must *emerge*. If they do not emerge, the methodology has a defect. There is no lookup table to fall back on."

    "## 1.2 What This Is Not\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity about boundaries prevents the kind of scope drift that turns a simulation framework into a collection of special cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a quantum chemistry code. No wavefunction is computed, no basis set is expanded, no exchange-correlation functional is evaluated. The potentials used here are analytic closed-form expressions motivated by quantum mechanics — Lennard-Jones captures the Pauli repulsion and London dispersion that arise from electron cloud interactions, Coulomb captures the monopole electrostatic field of net atomic charges — but they are evaluated as classical functions of interatomic distance. Electrons do not appear as explicit degrees of freedom. Where this approximation breaks down (charge transfer, covalent bond formation, orbital hybridization effects), the framework either operates within its valid domain or clearly labels the approximation being made.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a molecular database or a geometry lookup service. No external chemical databases are queried during a formation run. The periodic table provides elemental constants — mass, radius, electronegativity — and nothing else. The fact that methane is tetrahedral, that benzene is planar, that sodium chloride forms a face-centered cubic lattice: these are results the engine must produce, not inputs it consumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a general-purpose molecular dynamics package. The engine is optimized for the formation problem: starting from an arbitrary initial configuration, finding what structures the system relaxes into. Long-timescale transport properties (diffusion coefficients, viscosity, thermal conductivity) are outside the primary scope. The trajectories generated here are means to an end — the end being the quenched, classified formation — not objects of study in themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a visualization tool. Rendering, force arrow display, ball-and-stick models, interactive 3D manipulation: these are interface projections that exist for human inspection. Removing every line of visualization code must not change any physical result, any energy value, any formation classification. The physics layer has no dependency on the display layer."

    "## 1.3 The Periodic Table Commitment\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to use the periodic table as the sole fundamental data source is not arbitrary. It establishes a very specific contract about what the engine is allowed to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each element $Z \\in [1, 102]$, the following properties are available at startup, compiled into the binary:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Symbol | Units | Physical origin |\n",
    "|----------|--------|-------|----------------|\n",

    "| Electron affinity | $\\text{EA}$ | eV | Energy released upon electron attachment |\n",
    "| Valence electrons | $n_v$ | — | Electrons in the outermost shell |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Lennard-Jones parameters ($\\sigma$, $\\varepsilon$) are stored for 20 elements from the UFF parameterization of Rappé et al. (1992). Elements without explicit parameterization fall back to carbon-like defaults. This fallback is a labeled approximation, not a physical claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commitment means the following. If someone hands the engine the formula $\\text{Fe}_2\\text{O}_3$ and says \"what does this form at 300 K?\", the engine must answer using only the properties above plus the laws of classical mechanics. It cannot look up the corundum crystal structure. It cannot import DFT-optimized geometries. It must propagate iron and oxygen atoms under interatomic forces and see what comes out. If corundum comes out, the methodology is working. If something else comes out, either the force field is inadequate for iron oxides (which is a legitimate and documentable limitation) or there is a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint also means the engine has a well-defined *domain of validity*. The UFF-based LJ parameterization is accurate for organic molecules, reasonable for simple ionic and metallic systems, and progressively less reliable for lanthanides, actinides, and systems where many-body electronic effects dominate. The framework is honest about this: the self-audit infrastructure (§11) includes failure classification that flags out-of-domain compositions explicitly."

    "The formation engine is a classical-mechanical framework. It does not solve the Schrödinger equation. However, molecular properties that depend on electron distribution — partial charges, dipole moments, ionization potentials — can be estimated from topology and periodic-table data using well-established empirical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "All electronic predictions produced by this framework are **labeled effective approximations** derived from elemental properties. They are suitable for screening and ranking (\"is molecule A likely more polar than molecule B?\") but not for quantitative predictions that require quantum-mechanical accuracy.\n",
