    "Up to this point, VSEPR‑Sim has focused on **isolated molecular systems**: atoms connected by bonds, shaped by local constraints, and stabilized through energy minimization and interaction models. This phase is essential. It establishes determinism, physical intuition, and numerical trust at the smallest meaningful scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, molecules alone are not *materials*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next natural step is to move from **finite structures** to **extended order**—from systems where boundaries are explicit to systems where boundaries are implied by repetition. This transition marks the point where chemistry becomes materials science, and where simulation output begins to resemble experimentally measurable matter.\n",

    "## What Changes at This Stage\n",
    "\n",
    "Crystallography introduces a fundamentally different way of thinking about structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of absolute positions, we work with **relative positions within a repeating cell**.\n",
    "- Instead of isolated neighbors, we work with **periodic environments**.\n",
    "- Instead of "this molecule is stable," we ask **"what arrangement persists everywhere?"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not merely an increase in scale. It is a shift in **representation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where molecular simulation is about local equilibrium, crystallography is about **global consistency under symmetry and repetition**.\n"

    "## Why This Stage Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage is important for three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) It Enables Bulk Behavior\n",
    "Properties like density, coordination number, packing efficiency, elastic response, and phase stability only emerge when a structure is allowed to repeat indefinitely. Without crystallography, these properties cannot be meaningfully defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) It Forces Mathematical Discipline\n",
    "Periodic systems remove many shortcuts. Distances must be computed correctly under boundary conditions. Geometry must be invariant under translation. Small numerical errors compound quickly. This pressure strengthens the entire simulation core.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) It Bridges Chemistry, Engineering, and Physics\n",
    "Crystallography is where chemical bonding, mechanical response, and spatial symmetry intersect cleanly. That intersection is exactly where VSEPR‑Sim aims to operate.\n"

   "source": [
    "## How This Will Be Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "The crystallography stage is introduced as a **layered extension** of existing concepts, not as a monolithic feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Reframing Space\n",
    "Instead of storing atomic positions only in Cartesian space, atoms are described in **fractional coordinates** relative to a unit cell. This allows repetition, wrapping, and equivalence to be handled mathematically rather than heuristically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Defining the Unit Cell\n",
    "A crystal is defined by three lattice vectors plus a basis of atoms within that cell. This separation allows structure to be reasoned about independently of size. A single cell can represent an infinite solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Periodic Boundary Conditions\n",
    "Interactions are computed using the **minimum‑image convention**, ensuring each atom interacts with the nearest periodic copy of its neighbors. This preserves locality while enforcing global repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Deterministic Structure Generation\n",
    "Supercells, defects, and distortions are constructed through exact integer and matrix operations, ensuring reproducibility and canonical ordering—an essential requirement for regression testing and automated discovery.\n"

    "## The Mathematics Involved: Rigorous Formulation\n",
